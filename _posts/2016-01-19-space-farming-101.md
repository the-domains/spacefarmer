The beginning of my hydroponic adventure/experiment (AKA space farming) 

Why am I doing this?

Since getting out of the Army at the end of 2012 I've had an itch that I couldn't scratch. A symptom of the human condition and the certainty of a period at the end of my segment of time(at least until the clones come...or cyborgs). I've wanted to make something that would leave some form of mark that served as the equivalent of a initials carved in a tree, or a dog asserting their inner alpha/beta by peeing on that tree. I came up with a bunch of horrible ideas and never even tried to start most of them.
