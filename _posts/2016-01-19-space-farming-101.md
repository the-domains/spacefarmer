The beginning of my hydroponic adventure/experiment (AKA space farming) 

Why am I doing this?

**Short Version**: I like food. I like science. I like making stuff.

**Long Version**: Since getting out of the Army at the end of 2012 I've had an itch that I couldn't scratch. A symptom of that part of the human condition that guarantees a period at the end of my segment of time(at least until the clones come...or cyborgs). That ticking clock has left me with a desire to make something that would leave my mark to serve as the equivalent of a initials carved in a tree, or a dog asserting their inner alpha/beta by peeing on that tree. I came up with a bunch of horrible ideas and never even tried to start most of them

**Hydroponics 101**

Hydroponics has been around for a while. Basically it involves growing plants without dirt by supplying it with water that has a regulated PH and nutrient(fertilizer) content. There are varying levels of sophistication, but the goal of this project is to design and create a system that uses no growth media. I'm going to design some custom 3d printed parts to turn an aeroponic cloning system into a seed starter. By not using any growth media I'll reduce consumable costs, and reduce the likelihood of debris clogging critical pumps.
